(process:690): Telegram-WARNING **: 18:43:27.480: Unfortunately, GTK integration conflicts with qgtk2 platformtheme and style. Therefore, QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME and QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE will be unset.
Telegram-Message: 18:43:27.482: This can be ignored by setting TDESKTOP_I_KNOW_ABOUT_GTK_INCOMPATIBILITY environment variable to any value, however, if qgtk2 theme or style is used, this will lead to a crash.
Telegram-Message: 18:43:27.482: GTK integration can be disabled by setting TDESKTOP_DISABLE_GTK_INTEGRATION to any value. Keep in mind that this will lead to clipboard issues and tdesktop will be unable to get settings from GTK (such as decoration layout, dark mode & more).
